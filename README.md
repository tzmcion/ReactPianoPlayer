## Description

### What does this app do ?

I always wanted to create piano Tutorials like big youtubers, but I didn't want to pay for professional software, so I created it myself :). This app makes it super easy to create piano tutorials, it delivers some basic effects, basic sound, and if you can't record a midi file with softwares, you can record it there. Also with recording app gives you basic (super basic) sheet music. On top of that, app gives you plenty of ways to customize effects, colors, spped of playing. With this app you can learn and have fun.

### Technologies used

 * <b>Sass (scss)</b>
 * <b>Redux (a little)</b>
 * <b>NPM library</b>
